“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.
Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.
Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report)

“The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul


The first step in problem-solving is understanding the problem to be solved. How do you know you understand a problem or concept? Only if you can explain it in simple language. If you can't explain it, you really don't understand it well enough.

It is also important that you plan your solution. Never rush into solving any problem. An indispensable approach is drawing up a workable plan to resolve a any challenge. However knotty a problem is, any problem can be solve if you would put enough time into planning. 

Breakdown the steps and take each part one after the other.

Practice! Practice!! Practice!!!

You wouldn't learn much without constant practice.
